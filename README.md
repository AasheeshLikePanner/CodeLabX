# CodelabX

Welcome to **CodelabX** — a project I'm building with the simple idea of making code easier to understand by visualizing it.  

The goal is to create a space where you can paste your code and instantly see how it flows:  
🔹 Where the logic moves next,  
🔹 How each piece connects,  
🔹 And get a clear picture of what’s actually happening behind the scenes.

At the moment, this project is in its **very early stage** — no user interface yet, no fancy visuals, just ideas slowly turning into reality. I’m starting from scratch and shaping it step by step.

## 💡 What I Want To Build

CodelabX will help you:
- Understand your code through flowcharts and diagrams.
- Watch your code "run" visually — step by step.
- Trace exactly where the execution is going and why.
- Experiment with different inputs and see how the flow changes.
- And much more, as the project evolves.

The goal is to turn code from plain text into a visual, interactive experience that anyone can follow.

## 🗓️ Features — Coming As Development Grows

- [ ] Develop a smooth user Interface.
- [ ] Visualize code as a **flowchart** — see the logic path clearly.
- [ ] Step through your code using **Next / Previous** controls.
- [ ] Input your own code and watch the visual execution.
- [ ] View the **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** for deeper code insights.
- [ ] Dynamic diagrams that update based on your code or input.
- [ ] Future plans for more advanced visualizations, tools, and ideas as the project grows!

## ⚡ Current Status

Right now, the project is at the very beginning.  
I’m laying down the base, planning the design, and preparing the first steps towards turning code into a smooth, visual learning tool.
